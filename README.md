# The-Tetris
This is a project I built in order to get more familiar with Pygame. I do not have any vision or plan for a final version of this project. I am still learning coding, so I do plan on adding and updating functionality and visuals (using sprites) for this project as time passes.

This uses the Pygame module: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/

It also utilizes the Python time and random modules.

--Functionality for being able to pause the game is still being worked on. The game can pause if you press P, however, it does not un-pause.

You may play the game by downloading the code and running it in Python. I will try to provide an executable for the app if possible here.
